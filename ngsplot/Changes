2.00.1 June 19, 2013
    - This is a bug fix version. ngs.plot v2.00 will emit error if you want to 
      use a BED file as genomic regions for plot. The bug has been fixed.

2.00 June 18, 2013
    - Massive addition of support for other genomes such as rn5, mm10 and dm3 
      and other types of functional features like enhancers and dhs.
    - We can now add support for any genome in UCSC or Ensembl within a short 
      time.
    - A python script - ngsplotdb.py is developed to list installed genomes, 
      remove genomes or install new genomes.
    - Ensemble is now the default database.
    - Fixed a bug in plotting X-axis in avg. profiles introduced in v1.68.
    - Allow mapping quality to be 0.

1.68 May 8, 2013
    - Output gene order as shown in heatmap. Each replot will also generate a 
      new gene order.
    - Allow users to change colors of heatmaps (replot).
    - Added colorkey to heatmaps. You do not have to re-generate your plots, 
      use replot.r. Also allow a user to adjust scale at global, region and 
      local levels.
    - Better sizing of figures and margins in heatmaps.
    - Fixed a bug in X-axis plotting in heatmaps.
    - Added a switch to integrate with Galaxy installation.

1.67.1 Apr 26, 2013
    - Important bug fix: the heatmap does not follow the order of given gene 
      list even if "-GO none" is used. This has been fixed.
    - New option "-RZ" to remove profiles that contain zero signal across all 
      positions and all NGS samples.

1.67 Apr 25, 2013
    - Fixed a bug that may cause the program to exit when all mapping quality 
      values are NAs.
    - Automatically convert mapping scores of 255 if bam files are converted 
      from BedTools.
    - Fixed a bug that causes the program to exit when the flanking region 
      exceeds chromosomal start position in RNA-seq plotting.
    - Added gene information to hmX.txt files.
    - Misc. tiny bugs fixed.

1.66.2 Apr 4, 2013
    - Fixed a bug that can cause RNA-seq plotting to exit with an error 
      message stating widths(x) cannot be negative.

1.66.1 Apr 3, 2013
    - Fixed a bug that prevents replot from reading files correctly if the 
      original output name contains directory name.

1.66  Mar 26, 2013
    - Added a function to accept bam file pairs.
    - Automatically determine interval vs. flanking size in plot.
    - Fixed a bug in RNA-seq coverage calculation (Thanks to Alphonse Chu from 
      Ottawa to point out).
    - Minor bugs fixed.

1.65.1 Mar 18, 2013
    - Fixed a bug that emits errors when using a custom bed file (Thanks to 
      Timothy E. Reddy from Duke to point out).

1.65  Mar 12, 2013
    - This is an emergent bug fix version which addresses some problems when 
      reading bam header information.
    - If alignment algorithm cannot be determined, ngs.plot will try to 
      automatically convert mapping scores of 255 to sth. meaningful.
    - Uses a better way to read sequence names in a bam file.
    - Buffer size is automatically set based on fragment length.

1.64  Mar 7, 2013
    - Significant improvement to coverage calculation. The program now 
      calculate coverage based on needs by extracting bam files on the go. 
      This has significantly reduced memory requirement.
    - cov.calc.r has been removed from the package. There is no need to pre-
      calculate coverage any more.
    - replot.r now supports heatmap and a few other options to tune figures.
    - The result files are now wrapped as a zip file for cleaness.

1.34  Feb 23, 2013
    - A lot of code re-writing to optimize performance and to modularize the 
      project.
    - More usage of parallel processing.
    - Added new heatmap function.
    - Implemented 6 algorithms to order genes in heatmaps.
    - Added column subset function in replot.r.
    - Used robust statistics as default for avg. profile plot.

      folds.

1.05  Dec 3, 2012
    - Fix bugs in calculating physical coverage 
    - Fix bugs in the scripts that are used to extract exons from Cufflinks.

1.04  Nov 12, 2012 
    - Automatic turning off SEM when there is only single gene given in gene 
      list.
    - Misc. re-organization of ngs.plot.r code.
    - Some re-organization of distribution folder.
    - Added example gene list; example data for user to run through.
    - Added script "alt_reg_cufflinks" which extracts all alternative regions 
      in one command.
